# Research Report

## Summary
Applitools is an AI-powered testing platform that revolutionizes how teams test user interfaces across web, mobile, and other digital assets. By leveraging Visual AI, Applitools validates entire UIs in seconds‚Äîdetecting functional, visual, and accessibility issues that traditional test automation might miss. It separates **test interaction** from **test validation**, allowing teams to scale UI testing efficiently, reduce maintenance, and achieve human-like accuracy in automation.

## 1. Capabilities Overview

### üß† LLM Generated Test Steps
Applitools leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language descriptions into executable test steps.  
Instead of manually coding test cases, testers can describe their intent in plain English (e.g., *‚ÄúFill out the form as a QA Manager and submit it‚Äù*).  
Autonomous AI interprets this testing intent using natural language, analyses the application‚Äôs context in real-time, and generates relevant test steps. The generated steps are then verified and finalised by their Deterministic Language Model (DLM).

### üíæ LLM-Assisted Test Data Generation
Applitools enables users to generate dynamic, realistic test data directly from simple text prompts.  
Using LLMs, testers can request structured or random data (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers, or even domain-specific data like ‚Äúa French fashion designer profile‚Äù).  
This allows tests to run with diverse datasets without manual scripting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è TestGenAI for Cypress
**Applitools TestGenAI** simplifies the creation of Cypress tests for users of any skill level.  
It allows testers to record browser interactions, like clicks, typing, uploads, hovers, and assertions. Then automatically generate Cypress code, and create self-healing tests that adapt to UI changes.  
The tool also generates Page Object Models (POMs), promoting code reusability and test maintainability. It can detect and heal broken selectors automatically during execution.

### üëÅÔ∏è Applitools Eyes and Visual AI
Applitools Eyes is the **core AI-driven validation engine** that powers the platform‚Äôs visual testing capabilities.  
Unlike traditional automation tools that rely on static locators, Eyes analyses visual differences across elements, pages, and environments with human-like perception by using AI-powered **Visual Match Levels**.  
It can validate entire screens with one visual checkpoint, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

### üåç Extended Platform Capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Supports web, mobile, desktop, PDF, and multimedia UI validation.  
- **Contrast Advisor:** Ensures accessibility and visual contrast compliance.  
- **Localisation & Globalisation Testing:** Simplifies multi-language validation with separate baselines.  
- **A/B Testing Support:** Create and maintain multiple baselines for experimentation.  
- **Automated Maintenance:** Auto-updates baselines as UI changes evolve.  

---

## 2. Typical Use Cases

- **Functional Testing:** Validate business workflows and detect navigation or logic regressions.  
- **Visual Testing:** Identify misaligned elements, incorrect colors, missing UI elements, and brand inconsistencies.  
- **Accessibility Testing:** Validate visual accessibility and contrast compliance.  
- **Localisation Testing:** Manage multi-language baselines for global app testing.  
- **A/B Testing:** Support experiments through multiple baselines.  
- **Compliance & Documentation:** Automate PDF and digital document validation.

## 3. Pros

‚úÖ **Faster Test Creation:** Generate complete, AI-driven UI tests from natural language.  
‚úÖ **Help Visual Testing:** Validate entire interfaces with Visual AI checkpoints.  
‚úÖ **Self-Healing Tests:** Automatically fix locator-based failures.  
‚úÖ **Reduced Maintenance:** Minimise repetitive updates for UI changes.  
‚úÖ **Help Generate Cypress Code:** Help users create Cypress tests quickly by recording browser interactions and automatically generating executable, self-healing test code. It simplifies test creation, maintenance, and reuse through intelligent variable handling and Page Object Model (POM) generation. 
‚úÖ **Scalable Execution:** Run parallel tests efficiently in the Execution Cloud.  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Support:** Validate across web, mobile, and document environments.

## 4. Cons & Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Learning Curve:** Understanding AI-driven validation requires some onboarding.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Human Input:** An AI‚Äôs interpretation of the testing intent depends on the human‚Äôs prompt.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Framework Support:** Deepest integrations currently exist for Cypress, Selenium, and WDIO.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Black-Box AI:** Visual AI‚Äôs internal logic can sometimes be opaque to testers.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Trade-offs:** Context-aware scanning can slow down test authoring on large or complex pages.

## 6. Recommendation

‚úÖ **Recommended For:**  
- Teams seeking scalable, low-maintenance UI testing solutions.  
- Enterprises looking for AI-driven visual validation and functional coverage.  
- QA organisations handling dynamic, large-scale, or multi-lingual applications.  
- Companies aiming to minimise flaky test results and maintenance overhead.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Caution If:**  
- Your testing toolchain depends on unsupported frameworks or environments.  
- You require complete transparency in AI-driven decision-making.  
- You prefer traditional code-based testing without AI augmentation.
