# KushoAI — Research Report

**Summary (one line)**  
KushoAI is an AI-powered tool that auto-generates API and UI test suites from specs or recordings; strong in API coverage, but UI features are still brittle.

**Link:** https://docs.kusho.ai/

## 1. Capabilities Overview

### I. API Testing

**Inputs Supported**  
- API details like HTTP method, URL, request body  
- OpenAPI / Swagger spec (JSON)  
- Postman collection  
- cURL command  

**Outputs and Features**  
- **Generates API test cases (positive, negative, edge cases)**<br>
  API test cases are generated by AI. It includes both positive and negative scenarios. Edge cases are included as well.

  **Generated API Tests:** [KushoAI_Test Suites](https://github.com/XChenscottlogic/AI-Testing-Experiment/blob/main/KushoAI/tests%20generated%20by%20AI.json)
  
- **Customise assertions (manually or AI-generated)**<br>
  Assertions can be added manually or generated by AI.

- **Environment Selection**<br>
  Users can define and configure custom test environment.

- **Run tests on its UI**<br>
  Tests can be run directly on its UI platform.

- **Parallel execution supported**<br>
  It can run API calls in parallel to reduce latency and improve efficiency.
  
- **Workspace UI to manage APIs and test suites**<br>
  It offers workspace feature which user can organise and manage API and test suites easily.
  
- **CI/CD integration (Enterprise only)**<br>
  
- **Test report generation (Enterprise only)**<br>
  
- **End-to-end testing across multiple APIs (beta, Enterprise only)**<br>

### II. UI Testing

- Users can record actions on the web; AI generates Playwright scripts from recordings.
 **Note:** reliability is low in current demos (many unexplained failures)  
- Enterprise version supports additional languages beyond Playwright. 

---

## 2. Typical Use Cases

- Quickly generate baseline API tests  
- Automate regression and smoke suites  
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines (if Enterprise)  
- Use workspace to collaborate and organise test assets  

---

## 3. Pros

- Big time savings compared to hand-coding tests to create automation from scratch 
- Flexible input formats (specs, Postman, cURL)  
- Parallel execution reduces test latency  
- Workspace and UI make test management easier  
- Scalable option via Enterprise features  

---

## 4. Cons & Limitations

- **Unstable UI testing:** Current UI tests are inconsistent and prone to flakiness.
- **Feature limitations:** Critical capabilities such as CI/CD integration, advanced reporting, and end-to-end testing are restricted to the Enterprise plan.
- **AI-generated test limitations:** Automatically generated tests often require manual adjustments, as the AI is not aware of complex business logic.
- **Data security concerns:** On-premises deployment is available only in the Enterprise version. It is concerned to upload API specifications or requests to the remote server.
- **Lack of transparency:** Users cannot configure or view details about the underlying AI model in use.

## 5. Pricing Snapshot

- Freemium tier for experimentation  
- Enterprise tier unlocks CI/CD, reporting, advanced testing
  ![Features Supported by Enterprise Version](https://github.com/XChenscottlogic/AI-Testing-Experiment/blob/main/KushoAI/Screenshot_Features%20Supported%20by%20Enterprise%20Version.png)
- Exact pricing depends on test volume, users, and features (check KushoAI’s site)

## 6. Recommendation

**✅ Recommended For:**  
Teams wanting rapid API test coverage with minimal setup.

**⚠️ Use Caution If:**  
- You depend heavily on UI/E2E testing, require strict on-prem security, or cannot invest time in validating AI-generated tests.
- You have existing automation framework for API testing.
