## 1. AI Capabilities Overview
- **(BETA) AI Test Case Generation:** Automatically creates comprehensive & actionable test cases from prompts, PRDs, user stories, or images. 
- **(BETA) Identify Duplicate Test Cases:** Identify duplicate test cases (exact same and semantic similar) & get smart suggestions to merge or archive them.  
- **Self-Healing Automation:** Detects and fixes broken element locators at runtime, reducing automation failures by up to 40%.

- **(BETA) Low-Code Authoring:** Converts natural language prompts into dynamic, context-aware test steps, accelerating test creation.  
- **(BETA) Cross-Browser Automation:** Write browser and app tests in natural language and run them across different platforms.
- **Test Failure Analysis:** Analyses logs to pinpoint root cause of failures and provide actionable fixes.

- **Issue Detection and Remediation:** Auto-detect accessibility issues and translate detected issues into actionable solutions with fix recommendations.
- **Visual Review (Percy):** Uses AI to highlight meaningful visual changes while filtering out pixel-level noise.  
- **Accessibility (Ally) Agents:** Detect and remediate complex WCAG issues with contextual AI guidance.  
- **(BETA) AI Test Selection:** Identify the most relevant tests in a test run.
- **(UPCOMING) Test Data Generation:** Produces realistic data to simulate real-world usage and enhance test coverage.
- **(UPCOMING) Test Plan Creation:** Create test plans based on requirements & past test data.

## 2. Typical Use Cases
- Automating test creation directly from PRDs or user stories.  
- Maintaining test stability in dynamic UI environments.  
- Accelerating test authoring through low-code or natural language inputs.  
- Conducting visual regression and accessibility testing at scale.  
- Prioritising high-risk tests using AI-driven insights.  
- Streamlining continuous testing in CI/CD workflows (note: this is an existing feature).

---

## 3. Pros
- Significant reduction in test maintenance through self-healing automation.  
- Low-code and NLP-driven authoring empowers non-technical users.  
- Robust visual testing and accessibility support (Percy and Ally agents).  
- Strong integration with CI/CD pipelines and popular dev tools.  
- Context-aware AI insights for test creation, selection, planning, and defect prediction.  
- Cloud-based scalability and collaboration features.
