# Testim — Research Report

## Summary

Testim Copilot Coding Assistant is an AI-powered tool integrated within the Testim testing platform to help users write, understand, and fix JavaScript code that supports custom testing steps. It leverages OpenAI’s generative AI models, customised for Testim’s automated testing environment.  

Through a chat-based interface and special slash ("/") commands, users can generate, explain, or fix code snippets for various types of custom validations and actions. This accelerates test creation, reduces manual coding effort, and enhances code comprehension directly within the Testim UI.

  ![error fixing](https://github.com/XChenscottlogic/AI-Testing-Experiment/blob/Xin-branch/Testim/Screenshot%20Fix%20the%20code.png)
- Supports Testim-specific steps such as:
  - Add Custom Action  
  - Add Custom Validation  
  - Add Custom Wait For  
  - Add Network Validation  
  - Add CLI Validation  
  - Validate Download  
  - Custom Condition  
- Integrates **OpenAI’s generative AI** into Testim’s UI via chat pane.

- Allows both **natural language prompts** and **slash commands**:
  - `/generate` – create JS code  
  - `/explain` – explain selected code  
  - `/fix` – suggest fixes  
  - `/help` – access assistant documentation  
- Offers direct actions:
  - *Paste code at cursor*  
  - *Copy code*

## 2. Typical Use Cases

- Generating JavaScript snippets for automated test steps quickly.  
- Debugging or improving custom test logic written in JavaScript.  
- Learning the scripting syntax through AI explanations.  
- Validating or fixing existing scripts without switching editors.  

---

## 3. Pros

- **Fast code creation:** Instantly generates usable JS test code.  
- **Built-in explanations:** Helps users understand complex code.  
- **Context-aware fixing:** Suggests precise corrections for test scripts.  
- **Seamless integration:** Embedded directly within Testim’s workflow.  
- **Intuitive chat UI:** Easy prompt-based interaction with AI.

## 4. Cons & Limitations

- **Step-level generation only:** The Copilot can generate code for individual Testim steps (e.g., a single validation of web elements on a particular page), but it does not yet support producing a full sequence of steps or an end-to-end test workflow.
- **Limited test coverage:** Currently it can only generate tests based on its options provided.
- **No execution-level debugging:** While the assistant can identify and fix syntax errors, it cannot access runtime or execution errors. It does not perform live debugging or analyse test failures, which limits its utility for deeper troubleshooting.
- **Isolated code snippets:** Generated code remains confined within Testim’s interface. There is currently no seamless way to combine multiple snippets into a complete, runnable script that can be executed in an external IDE or test framework.
- **Dependent on Testim environment:** Since all interactions occur inside the Testim UI, integration with external development workflows or CI/CD pipelines is minimal.

## 5. Pricing Snapshot

- 30-day trial for all users.  
- No separate public pricing for the Copilot feature as of current documentation.  
- Testim’s pricing is typically enterprise-oriented, with quotes provided upon request.

## 6. Recommendation

✅ **Recommended For:**  
- Manual QA engineers looking to learn web test automation using JavaScript.  
- Teams needing quick code generation and debugging support.  

⚠️ **Use Caution If:**  
- Your would like to create end-to-end tests or an automation test framework.  
- You rely heavily on non-JS scripting or custom frameworks outside Testim.  
- You need some assistance with generating test ideas.
