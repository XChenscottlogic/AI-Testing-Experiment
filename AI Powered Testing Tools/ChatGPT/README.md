# ChatGPT for Software Testing — Research Report

---

### **Summary**

ChatGPT is a large language model that can assist software testers by accelerating test design, improving documentation quality, generating test data, assisting debugging, and supporting automated testing workflows. While it does not replace formal automation frameworks or human decision-making, it provides strong value as a reasoning assistant, productivity booster, and exploratory testing support mechanism. Its usefulness depends heavily on prompt quality, context provided, and responsible usage.

## 1. Capabilities Overview

ChatGPT, as a **testing augmentation tool**, can support multiple stages of the software testing lifecycle by leveraging natural language understanding, reasoning, and code generation capabilities. Rather than functioning as a standalone automation tool, it enhances existing workflows by producing testing artefacts, assisting troubleshooting, and supporting reasoning-based analysis.

Key testing capabilities include:

- **Test Case Generation:** Creates manual or automated test cases based on requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, or source code.
- **Automation Script Assistance:** Generates boilerplate automation code for frameworks such as Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, JUnit, PyTest, and Robot Framework.
- **Test Data Creation:** Produces boundary values, randomised datasets, synthetic user profiles, edge-case inputs, or fuzzing-style input patterns.
- **Exploratory Testing Assistance:** Suggests potential failure scenarios, risk-based test heuristics, and scenario-based test ideas.
- **Defect Analysis Support:** Helps interpret stack traces, troubleshoot errors, review logs, and suggest potential fixes or investigation paths.
- **Documentation Support:** Writes or refines acceptance criteria, user stories, test plans, risk statements, or traceability matrices.
- **Learning & Knowledge Enablement:** Serves as an on-demand tutor for frameworks, test concepts, standards, or programming problems.

These capabilities help reduce cognitive load, improve testing depth, support scalability, and enhance the efficiency of both manual and automated test processes.

## 4. Cons & Limitations

- May generate inaccurate or non-executable code without validation  
- Output quality depends on prompt clarity and contextual detail  
- Not a replacement for real test execution or human verification  
- Cannot ensure compliance or full domain correctness without review  
- Risk of hallucination—results must be validated  
- Requires careful handling of confidential or proprietary data
